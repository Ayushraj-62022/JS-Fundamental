Q Explain what javascript is and its role in web development.

Ans = JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does
 more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D
  graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of 
  standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.


    a) HTML is the markup language that we use to structure and give meaning to our web content, for example defining paragraphs, headings, and
         data tables, or embedding images and videos in the page.
    b)    CSS is a language of style rules that we use to apply styling to our HTML content, for example setting background colors and fonts, and 
            laying out our content in multiple columns.
    c)    JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and 
            pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.

JavaScript interacts with the Document Object Model (DOM), which represents the webpage's structure. This
interaction enables developers to manipulate and modify webpage content, styles, and layout in response to
user actions. JavaScript also handles events, making it possible to create interactive web applications.
