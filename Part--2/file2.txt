JavaScript is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. It is a high-level scripting language introduced by Netscape 
to be run on the client-side of the web browser. It can insert dynamic text into HTML.JavaScript is also known as the browser’s language.
It is a programming language conforming to the specification of ECMAScript. Often abbreviated as JS, JavaScript is a scripting language of high
 level that can be used to insert some dynamic texts into the HTML code. Thus, it is also called the browser’s language. Netscape introduced it
  for running on a web browser’s client-side. Branden Eich designed the JS, and it first appeared back in 1995. The ECMA group
   (European Computer Manufacturers Association) standardised it and also maintained it; thus, it was initially named ECMAScript as a standard.

To interpret the JS code and run it in a program, one would always require the JS engine. These days, a majority of web browsers have this JS
 engine on both server-side as well as client-side.

HTML:
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. It is the 
combination of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between the web pages.
The term HTML is an abbreviation for HyperText Markup Language. HTML is basically the building block of the basics of the web that defines the 
structure and meaning of the web content. It’s a combination of the hypertext along with the markup language, where the hypertext defines the link
 present between the various web pages in the website.

The HTML language was released back in 1993. The latest version of HTML, as of now, is HTML 5.2, and the extensions can be either .htm or .html, 
where we most commonly use the .html extension.

The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) developed HTML along with the Web Hypertext App Tech Working Group (WHATWG). We can also modify the look and 
make HTML web pages look better when we include Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). The W3C maintains the CSS. It makes the overall look and feel of web
 pages better and richer by including or loading the contents in an HTML web page.
