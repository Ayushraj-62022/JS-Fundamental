Q Explain the importance of choosing meaningful and descriptive  variables name in javascript. Provides an example where using a clear identifiers 
improve code readibility.
Ans = Readability and Understandability: Clear and meaningful variable names make your code more readable and understandable. When someone,
 including yourself, reads the code later on, descriptive variable names make it easier to comprehend the purpose and intent of the variable. 
 It reduces confusion and helps in quickly grasping the logic and flow of the program.

 Maintainability and Debugging: Well-named variables facilitate code maintenance and debugging. If you or someone else needs to modify or fix a
  piece of code, having meaningful variable names makes it easier to identify which variables are involved and their purpose. This speeds up the
   debugging process and reduces the chances of introducing errors when making changes.

   Collaboration and Teamwork: When working in a team environment, using clear and consistent variable naming conventions becomes even more
    critical. It promotes effective collaboration by enabling team members to understand each other's code easily. It also reduces communication
     barriers and makes code reviews and discussions more efficient.

     let a = 10; // Price of the product

    let b = 5;  // Quantity of the product

    let total = a * b; // Calculate total cost
