Q What is the purpose of declaring variables in javascript and how do you declare using the let keyword.
Ans = The let keyword in Javascript was introduced in 2015 with ES6. Just like var in Javascript, let keyword is also used for variable
 declaration. But the only difference is the variable declared with the “let” keyword is block-scoped and local variable. A variable declared
  with let will be out of scope outside the block within which it has been declared.

  In JavaScript, let is a keyword that is used to declare a block scoped variable. Usually, the var keyword is used to declare a variable in
   JavaScript which is treated as a normal variable, but the variables declared using the let keyword are block scoped.

JavaScript provides three ways to declare a variable: var, const, and let. These keywords deliver different functionality from each other.
 Var is a traditional method to declare a variable while const and let keyword was introduced later by the ES2015/ES6, which creae block scope 
 variable.
