Q List and describe the five primitive data types in javascript.

Ans = In Javascript, there are five basic, or primitive, types of data. The five most basic types of data are strings, numbers, booleans, undefined, and null. We refer to these as primitive
 data types. 
 Strings
A string is a collection of alphanumeric characters. I start a string by typing double quotes, single quotes, or the backtick character. Double
 quote and single quote behave identically, and the backtick character comes with some extra functionality.

 Numbers 
Numbers. Let’s talk about numbers. Numbers are as straightforward as they sound. Numbers are for numbers. I can’t put a letter on here

Booleans
Booleans have two values. True and false. When we create a boolean, we’re simply saying it’s true or it’s false. It’s like that on/off switch 
example that we talked about. It’s all there is to them right now.

Undefined
The meaning of undefined is ‘value is not assigned’.

Null
This data type can hold only one possible value that is null.

BigInt
This data type can represent numbers greater than 253-1 which helps to perform operations on large numbers. The number is specified by writing ‘n’
 at the end of the value
